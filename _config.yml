      Lato was chosen as the primary font because it is a modern and pleasing font. Although there are many options for modern fonts, this one specifically is very neutral so it won't look off-putting next to any of the jewelry photos. Lato is the only font, it is to be used for each part of the website using its different weights and sizes to add emphasis.
